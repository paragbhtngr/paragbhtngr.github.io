References can be a shorthand, a litmus test to draw out these timid creatures who don't display their fandoms out in the open. I've made very obscure references in the past hoping to find my people, and sometimes I do find them.

But for everyone a reference includes, there are those who may feel excluded by not being in on the joke. Most people have likely been part of a group when the entire group gets something that one person doesn't. And that's not a fun feeling, if the group uses it as a way of excluding you. I'm far from one to dictate how you should choose to communicate, but my personal approach to it is to either make a reference most people will get, or a reference most people will not get - for that one person who does they will feel extra special for having got it, while making most people not feel left out.
