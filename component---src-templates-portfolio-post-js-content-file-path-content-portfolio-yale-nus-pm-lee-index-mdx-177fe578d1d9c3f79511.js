Obsessing slightly over the number I was reminded of an image I had seen during our last week at our Yale summer immersion program, in a talk about liberal arts and its place in our world. It was this depiction of the three tenets of the classical liberal arts - grammar, logic and rhetoric - called the Trivium.
