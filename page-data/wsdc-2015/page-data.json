The asymmetrical\nand off-centre core of the logo was a vestige from the previous design - a call to\nthink laterally. To offset the weight visually, I positioned the stars and the wsdc\nlogo to the right, to act as a counterbalance.\n"},"previous":{"frontmatter":{"slug":"alchemy","title":"Alchemy: A Yale-NUS literary collective"}},"next":{"frontmatter":{"slug":"ync-orientation-2015","title":"Yale-NUS College Orientation 2015"}}},"pageContext":{"id":"33127c26-3606-56f4-a017-09f23295b9ff","previousPostId":"d2263a2a-99c7-5c89-99c2-8f882226a52a","nextPostId":"9f746fb8-691b-5acf-866c-0ccb60d0eac5","frontmatter":{"title":"World Schools Debating Championships 2015","date":"2015-05-20","description":"In 2015, I was asked to design the logo of for the World School Debating Championships","slug":"wsdc-2015","post":"portfolio","featuredImage":"./wsdc.png"}}},"staticQueryHashes":["2841359383","3257411868"],"slicesMap":{}}
