He was right of course. You can't stuff the pipe. You can't smoke it. It is a representation that is enough to remind you of the thing itself. For the programmers reading this - there is the object, and then there is a pointer to the object. Creating an image of an object is a pass by reference. It is not the thing itself. Similarly, I posit what I assume will be an uncontroversial opinion that words are also not the elements themselves. Rather they are pointers that tell our brains to think about things we've seen.

Constructs upon constructs that you have to process for every word you say. It's a wonder we manage to communicate at all. If you look at Twitter, it makes a lot more sense now. There's a reason computer programmers made sure a pointer pointed to one thing, and not several different things depending on who is saying it and who is listening and what the context is. Words are hard. Take the word man. In and of itself, the word man can just mean any male human being. But we've complicated it just a bit.
