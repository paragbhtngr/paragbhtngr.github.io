Companies would be able to control how they would share earnings at a granular level. This could lead to more of them willing to work together in more complex ways. For example, take Spider-Man: No Way Home. This movie was possible because Sony and Disney were able to collaborate to make it happen. In a world with widespread adoption of NFTs, these companies could create tickets for the movie with the exact breakdown of the profit split. Say Marvel got to keep more money from the movies, and Sony from the toys. If the toys came with NFTs, the breakdown of the profits from each of those could be programmed right into the contract.
