<br />I had the opportunity to do some illustrations for the book "Employee A&E:
Manager's Edition", a book that provides fresh perspectives on how managers can create
a positive workplace environment for their employees based on psychological and sociological
principles. The book helps managers identify and resolve the issues of bullying,
bellitlement and burnout at the workplace, creating an environment where everyone
feels respected, safe, trusted, united and valued.

The illustrations help visualize metaphors and psychological concepts explained in the book, and were done in pencil, before inking and then some shading done digitally. This project was really fun to work on because I had the freedom to explore how to visualize some pretty complex psycological processes, and I learned a lot about mental states and health in the process.

If you haven't read it, I highly recommend giving it a go - if you're a manager it will definitely help you understand how to manage employee's emotional states and create a positive workplace enviroment. If you're not, it's still a very insghtful look into how we function as people.
