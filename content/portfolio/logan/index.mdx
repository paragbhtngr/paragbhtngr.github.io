I can't think of a more fitting ending for Hugh Jackman's Wolverine, or indeed Patrick Stewart's Charles Xavier than Logan. A pitch-perfect movie in almost every regard, and gut-wrenching in every sense of the word. It's been 17 great years with Hugh playing the mutton-chopped, cigar-smoking, claw-wielding badass and now it's time to say goodbye.
