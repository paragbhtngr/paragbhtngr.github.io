<br />
In 2015, I was asked to design the logo of for the World School Debating Championships.
The logo was a remake of a design that was being played around with at the time.
The logo is an homage to the singapore flag and the crescent with 5 stars. The asymmetrical
and off-centre core of the logo was a vestige from the previous design - a call to
think laterally. To offset the weight visually, I positioned the stars and the wsdc
logo to the right, to act as a counterbalance.
