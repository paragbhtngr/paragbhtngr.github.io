Possibly one of my favourite projects to work on in recent memory, The Flying Fido
is a pet relocation service to help you transport your pets from one country to another,
making the entire process hassle-free.

  <small>Ideation for logo design</small>
</figcaption>

<br />

The logo went through various iterations, including superhero-dogs, dogs
bounding out of boxes and even an aviator dogs. Ultimately I decided that it
would be best for the dog to be riding pillion on this trip. The idea of a dog
emerging out of a box or cage also seemed to suggest that it had been a box for
the duration of the trip, which did not sound particularly inviting either.
Ultimately, the inspiration came from the classic image of the dog sticking its
head out of a car window, except the car was replaced with airplane windows -
not a realistic depiction of airline travel perhaps, but sentiment-wise, it hit
all the right notes.

As for the choice of dog, there were a lot of strong contenders - the owner's pug was one of them, but pugs are not necessarily adored by all. A shiba inu, or "doge", was another contender, but felt a little too meme-y and a look of bemused wonderment wasn't the emotion I was going for. In the end, I went with corgis, because in my opinion, they are the floofiest, and they generally have the expression of pure happiness and excitement that I was going for. They are also ideal candidates for being taken somewhere because their tiny little legs aren't going to carry them very far on their own.
