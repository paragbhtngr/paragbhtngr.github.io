If you're familiar with improv, feel free to skip this paragraph. For the rest, Improv is short for improvisational theatre - a form of collaborative storytelling where no one knows where the story will go. It is different from scripted storytelling in that there is no script, no predetermined characters and no one person knows the full story. A lot of popular improv is associated with comedy, if you've seen ",o.createElement(t.em,null,"Whose Line Is It Anyway?")," or perhaps even ",o.createElement(t.em,null,"Middleditch and Schwartz")," on Netflix, you may have seen examples of improvised storytelling at work.

It achieves brevity and elegance in a way I wish I could with a lot of my writing, but allow me to expound on what it means a bit for the uninitiated. “Yes, And” is a response to an offer. An offer in improv terms is any piece of information presented within a scene - be it an offer of information about a character in the story, an endowment of a trait or history to your character, exposition about relationships or other characters, or even a suggestion to do something given the situation. Basically, any piece of information that has the potential to move the story forward is an offer. The principle of “yes, and”-ing an offer means that you accept whatever was said and you add to it."),"\n",o.createElement(t.p,null,"There are various ways to respond to an offer, but yes and is the one that will allow you to move the story forward. Take an example scene: You're sitting down at a table, and your scene partner comes and sits next to you, offers you an apple and says, “Here you go. Can't stand apples. Don't know why they stopped giving us oranges.” That's a pretty good starting offer. It establishes familiarity, details about the partner's character, possibly details about your relationship (that you've known each other for a while and this is not the first time they're giving you their food). Here's how you could react to that:"),"\n",o.createElement(t.ul,null,"\n",o.createElement(t.li,null,"No: You reject their offer. This is not an apple.

Turns out she's allergic to oranges. Now the whole school can't have them."),"\n"),"\n",o.createElement(t.p,null,"Which one of these responses feels the most satisfying? The no just completely shatters the world that your partner is trying to build. You delegitimize what they're saying and the audience loses suspension of disbelief as they are abruptly brought out of the scene. With a yes but, you are acknowledging that something has happened, but you are refusing to participate in moving forward. Now the scene can still happen around you, but the more you push back the harder it is to work with you. Now, the yes and. That not only accepts but adds to the scene in a constructive manner. It builds the scene further. And there isn't really such a thing as a bad offer. Consider the following other offers:"),"\n",o.createElement(t.ul,null,"\n",o.createElement(t.li,null,"Thanks, Pete.

I shall have to jetpack over to the store, hopefully we still have our warranty records."),"\n"),"\n",o.createElement(t.p,null,"I could go on, but you see how none of these offers have anything in common with each other apart from the fact that they acknowledge and accept everything that has been established so far. So there are no such things as bad offers really, so long as they acknowledge everything that has happened before them. I'd like to point out something, whether you accept the apple or not is irrelevant. A misconception regarding yes, and-ing is that we must become some Yes Man like caricature of a person saying yes to everything without thinking. That's hardly the case.

If people fought in real life as much as they did in an improv 101 class, these people would be very unpleasant to hang out with. But why does conflict arise in a scene. Say, instead of offering an apple in that first scene, the scene partner had said, \"Sorry we're out of oranges\". Instead of an opportunity as an offer, I've given you a problem as an offer. Performing theatre without lines in front of dozens of people is, for most people, a stressful situation. In a stressful problem solving situation, a fight or flight response is common. Instead of figuring out what to do next, the first instinct is to assign blame. Clearly, it's the person who made the offer.

Can you ask them nicely? Is there some sequence of people-pleasing conflict-avoidant actions I can take so that this problem doesn't exist anymore in the scene? A lot of what people think of as problem-solving is actually trying to negotiate their way out of a problem. This makes for boring theatre.

Most poor improv scenes will not reach this stage, but flit around the first 3 stages. This stage is more prevalent in our personal lives, where we accept reality, but languish in it to punish ourselves. Given that we can't find anyone else to blame, it becomes our fault.
