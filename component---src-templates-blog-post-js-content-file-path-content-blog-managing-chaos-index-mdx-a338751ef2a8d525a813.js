Until then, I had only ever focused on doing what I needed to do and to do it well. From my perspective, having direct responsibility over execution was always easier. Be good at what you need to do, do the tasks assigned to you within the allotted time, and you don't need to worry about much else. At least, this is the way it works when you have a good manager, every one of us should be so lucky. Having indirect responsibility, is a very different ball game. You're not directly responsible for execution but are now reliant on others to get stuff done. You are responsible for prioritizing what needs doing, and unblocking people to make sure stuff gets done on time.
