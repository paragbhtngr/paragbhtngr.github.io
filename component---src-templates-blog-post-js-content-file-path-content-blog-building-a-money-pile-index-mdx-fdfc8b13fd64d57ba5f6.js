Look at all the people we worship and revere - CEOs, actors, celebrities, titans of industry, all sitting on their piles. Some people we worship just because they've spent their entire life building a bigger pile than everyone else. Warren Buffet, the Oracle of Omaha, the most prolific investor of our time - most people worship him for having a bigger pile than most people can build over multiple lifetimes.

My desire to avoid making choices about what I want to do with my life other than try to optimise for how much I made led me down a path of conforming to this idea that I need to build the biggest pile I can.
