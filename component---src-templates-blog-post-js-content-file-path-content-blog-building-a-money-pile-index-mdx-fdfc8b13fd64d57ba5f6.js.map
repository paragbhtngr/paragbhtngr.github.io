I grew up associating failure with death (in a metaphorical, not so much a literal sense). To survive, you weren't allowed to fail. So I played the statistically likeliest route of not failing.

Look at all the people we worship and revere - CEOs, actors, celebrities, titans of industry, all sitting on their piles. Some people we worship just because they've spent their entire life building a bigger pile than everyone else. Warren Buffet, the Oracle of Omaha, the most prolific investor of our time - most people worship him for having a bigger pile than most people can build over multiple lifetimes.

I asphyxiated my wants a while ago in the name of trying to survive, so being allowed to want things and trying to figure out what those things are feels a little like trying to raise the dead. But I'm looking for signs of life wherever I see them now. I'm factoring in the value of life experiences as well, and trying to optimise for that more than trying to build the biggest pile I can (Die With Zero by Bill Perkins is a book that has helped me with somewhat with that).

In terms of finding control over my life, I am not seeking money so much as knowledge that I have the ability to create money whenever I choose.
